# Blood-Donation
Introduction
In my Blood donation Management, I prepared a website where those who want to donate their blood can donate and help the needy people.
The website is developed by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Basic PHP. This will be useful to the users who donate blood and also the user who needs the blood.
The main objective to make a web based blood management is to manage the records of donors and recipients and encourage other people to donate the blood.


As It gives a good functionality to search the donors on the home page only so user don’t want to sign in to search the donors but further If they want to donate or
need the blood then they want to Sign in. If Users already sign in the page and fulfill all the details of admin then they don’t need to sign in again and again. After, 
they just have to login the page. It also provides the functionality like user is in the city like Ahmedabad and if they need a blood urgently then they can choose a
city with Ahmedabad. So, we said that it is user-friendly.
